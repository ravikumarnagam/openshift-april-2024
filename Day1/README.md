# Day 1

## Troubleshooting RPS Cloud Login
```
- The user-id that was shared to you seems to miss letter 'u', so you need to type your username as 24MAN0113-u25.
- The last two digit number in the username would vary for each participant.
```

## Pre-test - kindly complete the pre-test from your RPS Lab machine
<pre>
https://app.mymapit.in/code4/tiny/8Y8cj9
</pre>

Note
<pre>
- Copy/Paste between your laptop and rps lab machine is disabled as per your bank policy
- You don't have to enable the camera access
- Kindly use your personal email-id while registering ( avoid using BOFA id )
- The link above may not work directly from your work laptop web browser
- Once you are done with the test we will start the training 
- Kindly leave a message via WebEx chat if you have access, otherwise you may tell me
</pre>

## Verifying your Linux lab machine

Check if docker community edition is pre-installed
```
docker --version
```

Expected output
<pre>
